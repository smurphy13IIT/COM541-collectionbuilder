DavinLoh014,Davin_Loh_Interv.mp3,"Davin Loh gets asked a lot about pinballs within the interview, but he is more into arcade systems. Davin is a well known player at the Galloping Ghost arcade, hitting high scores and beating world records. Davin Loh is known within the community to be the best at a handful of games at the arcade, but the biggest one is ""Capcom vs SNK 2"". A fighting arcade game that puts two players against each other and fights with a 48 character roster, but it's not the multiplayer part he is known for. Davin focuses more on the single player mode, it pins the player to do countless battles against CPUs and then gets awarded points for a score and the more the player wins the higher the points, but the harder the fights become. He brings alot of attention to the arcade when he is attempting to break a record or high score, he has been such a positive player to have at the Galloping Ghost arcade.",Interview with Davin Loh,,audio/MP3,"Kilma, Zachary Ma, Yunlong Odutayo, Olufunlola Yang, Sunny",11/4/2014,Yes,Interview,Davin Loh,"Brookfield, IL",,,"Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 United States
